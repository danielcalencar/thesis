\section{Results for Study 1}\label{ch4:study1} 

In this section, we present the results with respect to the \textit{concrete
integration time} dimension. This dimension involves the investigation of
integration time in terms of number of releases and number of days
(\hyperref[def:1]{Definitions}~\ref{def:1} and \ref{def:2}). This dimension is
comprised of \hyperref[ch4:rq1]{RQ1}-\hyperref[ch4:rq4]{RQ4}. Below, we present the
obtained results for each RQ. 

%here goes RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3
