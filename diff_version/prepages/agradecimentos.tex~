	I belive that behind every scientific work there is an untold story that
	cannot be expressed by the methodologies, statistics and conclusions
	that are reported in the scientific papers. I dedicate this page to
	express my gratitude to some of the important pieces of my story.

	First and foremost, I would like to thank God for his blessings on every
	tiny step that was necessary to conceive this thesis. Among His
	blessings, I would like to start thanking my advisor Ahmed E. Hassan.
	Without his guidance and incentives, I would not be able to achieve the
	current state of this thesis. I would also like to thank my mentor and
	friend Shane McIntosh. His mentorship was fundamental to shape my work.
	I am also grateful to the co-authors of the publications that are
	directly and indirectly related to this thesis, Surafel Lemma Abebe,
	Weiyi Shang, Roberta Coelho, Christoph Treude, and Eduardo Aranha.
	Nevertheless, I could not have met these people without the support of
	my advisor and friend Uir\'{a} Kulesza, who always incentivized me to
	travel abroad and learn new skills. I am very grateful for his permanent
	support since my masters course.

	I am really grateful for my family, Danilo Alencar da Costa, Bruno
	Alencar da Costa, Carla Alencar da Costa, Maria Heliana Alencar da
	Costa, and Carlos Ara\'{u}jo da Costa. In my opinion, if one's mind is
	able to deeply focus on a problem that leads to a PhD thesis, its
	because there is a lovely family on its background.

	I have had the privillege of meeting wonderful friends during my PhD
	journey, Mohamed Sami Rakka, Guilherme Gon\c{c}alves, Gabriel dos Anjos
	Cavalcanti, Tiago Targino, Hernani (Sanilton) Sarra Filho, and Suhas
	Kabinna. Their friendship was essential to make my PhD experience much
	more enjoyable.  The same holds for my older friendships, Allan Santos
	dos Santos---which I consider an extension of my family---and Thiago
	Reis da Silva. 

	Finally, I am thankful to my girlfriend Renata Sousa for always
	believing on me. She has the talent to make me see myself as a better
	man.
