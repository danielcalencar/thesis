\section{Related Work} \label{ch6:relatedwork}

Since this work is the first to qualitatively investigate the delivery delay of
addressed issues (\ie by surveying and interviewing developers of our subject
projects), we survey related research that used a methodology similar to ours to
investigate other topics.

Treude~\etal~\cite{treude2015summarizing} studied what information developers
expect in a summary of development activities.  The authors found that {\em
unexpected events} are as important as {\em expected events} in a summary of
what a developer did.  Coelho~\etal~\cite{coelho2016exception} performed a
survey based study to investigate the perspectives of developers concerning
exception handling bug hazards in Android apps. The authors found that 64\% of
the participants recognized that they handle exceptions most of the time during
apps development.  Pinto~\etal~\cite{pinto2015automating} investigated whether
developers were aware about the performance issues that their tool was able to
automatically find. Pinto~\etal found that the minority of participants were
aware of the performance degradation cases that their tool was able to
automatically find.  Shimagaki~\etal~\cite{shimagaki2016study} qualitatively
studied the impact that modern code review practices have on the quality of a
proprietary system that is developed by Sony Mobile. The authors surveyed 93
stakeholders, of which 15 attended to follow-up interviews and 25 senior
engineers answered follow-up surveys. Differently from prior work, our study
focus on the qualitative investigation of delivery delays of addressed issues.
