\section{Results for Study 2} \label{ch4:study2} 

In \hyperref[ch4:study1]{Section}~\ref{ch4:study1}, we analyze integration
time with respect to the number of releases and number of days that an addressed
issue requires before integration. Additionally, we study projects with
different release cycles. For instance, in the Firefox project, we observed that
addressed issues have their integration prevented in two consecutive releases
(89\% of the addressed issues). However, a long delivery delay of one project
may be shorter than a typical integration time of another project. Hence, we set
out to complement our previous analyses by studying addressed issues that suffer
a long delivery delay when compared to other addressed issues of that particular
project.  This section addresses \hyperref[ch4:rq5]{RQ5} and
\hyperref[ch4:rq6]{RQ6}. We present the results for each RQ below.
