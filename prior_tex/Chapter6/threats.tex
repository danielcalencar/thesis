\section{Threats to Validity} \label{ch6:threats}

\textbf{\textit{Internal Validity.}} In our qualitative analysis, we had few
participants (37). However, such an analysis is important to (i) gain insights
from additional projects (ArgoUML and Eclipse) and (ii) better understand {\em
why} delivery delay happens.  Moreover, we choose methods from Grounded Theory
to perform our qualitative analysis. Although the coding process is performed by
two authors independently and reviewed by a third author, we cannot claim that
we reach all the perspectives that are possible from our questions.

\textbf{\textit{External Validity.}} External threats are concerned with our
ability to generalize our results. We survey participants from three different
projects (Firefox, ArgoUML, and Eclipse) and perform four follow-up interviews
to gain deeper insights about the responses that we obtain from our surveys.
Still, we cannot claim that our results are generalizable to other software
projects that are not studied in this work.  Hence, replication of this work
using other projects is required in order to reach more general conclusions.
